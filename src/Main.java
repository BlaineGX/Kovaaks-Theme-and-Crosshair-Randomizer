    // Deliverable:
    //  Kovaaks, is a name of a Aim Training Software that is used by many pros 
    // and semi-professionals to train their aim to get the mechanical advantage.
    // This program randomly selects:
    //  1. a theme and 2. a crosshair inside of the Kovaaks Steam folder.
    // The Program will show a popup with the theme name and the crosshair image/name.
    
    // Purpose:
    //  To give the user a random theme and crosshair to use in Kovaaks. 
    // It lets the user if they want to experiment with different themes and crosshairs.
    // With in my opinion, this is a good way to help train to give the user different themes to change the environment,
    // and different crosshair to change the way they hold their angles, flick, track, etc, to let them adapt to multiple 
    // different styles and techniques with the crosshair and eye training with seeing enemies and backgrounds in different colors.
